Abstract:
Hybrid rocket development relies on precise sensor data to evaluate key performance parameters such as thrust, temperature, and chamber pressure. The accuracy of this data is influenced not only by instrumentation noise but also by the design and efficiency of the test infrastructure. This study presents a comprehensive upgrade of a lab-scale hybrid rocket static fire test cart, focusing on improvements in oxidizer flow capacity, system wiring, data acquisition reliability, and load cell calibration. Key upgrades include implementation of larger-diameter piping for increased oxidizer flow, simplification of wiring to decrease instrument noise, installation of upgraded USB cables to increase data transfer bandwidth, and integration of a new load cell track to eliminate hysteresis. Comparative testing between the legacy and upgraded test carts assesses the impact of these design changes. The previous cart exhibited significant pressure data noise (standard deviation of 3.29 psi), while the upgraded system achieved improved signal clarity (standard deviation of 0.39 psi). Additional comparisons include oxidizer flow capacity, data transfer bandwidth performance, and load cell hysteresis quantification. Multiple test configurations and flow conditions are evaluated to quantify increases in performance and precision. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of these upgrades in improving calibration accuracy, test reliability, and providing insights into optimizing hybrid rocket test infrastructure for more precise and repeatable experimental data.
