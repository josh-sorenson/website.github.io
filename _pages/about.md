Josh Sorenson is a Graduate student at Utah State University earning his Masters degree in Aerospace Engineering. He is currently working as a Propulsion Engineer Intern at Hybird Space Systems where he is putting his engineering talents to the test, designing and building hybrid rockets. Along with hybrid rockets, Josh is interested in launch vehicles and satellite propulsion systems. He also earned his Bachelors degree at USU where he worked as a Propulsion Engineering Assistant at Space Dynamics Laboratory and a Research Assistant at the Propulsion Research Lab on campus. Both jobs fostered his growth and interest in space exploration.
